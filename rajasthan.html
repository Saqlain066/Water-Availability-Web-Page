    <p style="text-align: center;">Rajasthan has one of the lowest per capita renewable water resources in the 
        <br>world with an average annual per capita renewable freshwater availability of
        <br> 532 cubic meters which is only slightly more than the international minimum of
        <br> 500 cubic meters needed to avert what is referred to as a condition of absolute water .</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Unfortunately Rajasthan is the driest state in the country and is water scarce (having per capita water availability below 1000 m3/year) since 1991.</p>

    <p style="float: right; padding-right: 150px;">Rajasthan, located in the arid region of India, often faces water scarcity due
        <br> to its low rainfall and limited water resources. To cope with water shortages, 
        <br>various measures are taken: Rainwater Harvesting: Capturing and storing rainwater 
        <br>during the monsoon season for later use is a common practice in Rajasthan.</p>
