        <h1 style="text-align:center;">WATER AVAILABILITY</h1>
    </header>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Water availability is the quantity of water that 
        <br>can be useful to human beings without causing any harm to the ecosystem or other living creatures.
        <br> According to the statistics, almost 97% of the earth's water is saline, and among the available 3%, aquifers are considered economically useful water resources for human beings.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="width: 1200px; height: 600px;" src="water.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Water availability, both surface water and groundwater,
        <br> is crucial for various fields like agriculture, industry, energy generation and most importantly,
        <br> human consumption. Climate, local geological conditions, use of land, quality of water everything will affect the water availability.</p>
<br>
        <h2 style="padding-left: 70px;">Availability of Water on Earth</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 70px;">Approximately 71% of the earth’s surface is covered by water.
            <br> Water on earth can be divided into underground water and surface water.
            <br> Surface water includes water from the ocean, lakes, rivers, icetops, and glaciers.
            <br> Among these freshwater resources are water falling from the sky, lake, rivers, streams and underground water. </p>

        <p style="padding-left: 70px;">Underground water is the water below our feet that is more important to live. Surface water is mainly 
            <br>used for agricultural needs and as drinking water, whereas groundwater helps to keep rivers and lakes full.
            <br>  More than 8,400,000Km3 of freshwater is available on earth. Most of it is stored in ice caps and glaciers in the polar regions. </p>
                
        <p style="padding-left: 70px;">The water cycle has a crucial role in the <b>availability of water on earth.</b> Due to the water cycle, water on the earth
            <br> moves from one place to another, and because of it, water reaches animals and plants. The water cycle is driven by solar energy.
            <br><i> Deforestation, climate changes,</i> the channeling and diverting of waterways, etc. can influence the water cycle and thereby the availability of water on earth. </p>

        <h2 style="padding-left: 70px;">Water Resources</h2>
        <img style="width: 300px; padding-right: 40px; float: right;" src="resource.jpg" alt="">
        <p style="padding-left: 70px;">The meaning of water resources is the natural resources of water that can be useful to human beings. We 
            <br> are using water resources mainly as a source of drinking water and for agricultural purposes, household
            <br> activities, environmental activities, and industrial purposes. Among the available water resources oceans
            <br> are contributing 97% to the water availability. Underground water, surface water like rivers and lakes,and
            <br>"frozen water are the natural sources of freshwater." </p>

        <p style="padding-left: 70px;">Desalinated water and water obtained after wastewater treatments can be considered artificial water resources.
            <br> Water pollution, climate change, scarcity of water and various human activities badly affect water resources.</p>
            <br>

        <h2 style="padding-left: 70px;">Availability of Water Resources</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 70px;">Natural water resources can be broadly classified as surface water, underground water and frozen water.
            <br> Surface water resources are oceans, lakes and rivers. Aquifers are economically useful groundwater.
            <br> Water from ice caps and glaciers belongs to the category of frozen water resources. </p>

        <p> <ul style="padding-left: 100px;"> <li> <b>Saltwater:</b> About 97% of the earth's water is held by oceans. The sea water is salty because of 
            <br>the presence of chloride and sodium ions on a large scale. Along with that, elements like calcium 
            <br>magnesium, potassium, etc., are also found in seawater. Saltwater cannot be drunk directly or cannot
            <br> be used for irrigation. To use salt water for human needs, it should undergo a desalination process.
            <br> For people living in dry places, the desalination process provides much more fresh water. </li> </ul></p>

        <p> <ul style="padding-left: 100px;"> <li> <b>Ice- 2.06%:</b> Most of the freshwater on earth is stored in the form of ice. In the north and south poles,
            <br> ice is found as ice caps, and in the mountains, it is found in the form of glaciers. Approximately 90%
            <br> of the earth’s ice can be seen in Antarctica. </li></ul></p>

        <p> <ul style="padding-left: 100px;"> <li> <b>Groundwater- 0.9%: </b>Groundwater has been seen in every place on the earth below our feet. During
            <br> rain, rainwater is filtered through the soil and reaches the area where it is already saturated with water.
            <br> Depending on the depth of these areas groundwater can be days to thousands of years old. Aquifers are the
            <br> places where groundwater collects in water wells and are the most economical water resources for human beings.</li></ul></p>

        <p> <ul style="padding-left: 100px;"> <li> <b>Lakes- 0.008%:</b> Lakes are formed either by the accumulation of snow or by the seeping out 
            <br>of groundwater to the surface of the earth. Lakes can contain both freshwater and salty water.
            <br> Freshwater lakes are highly important for people.</li></ul></p>

            <br> of time. Deltas, estuaries, marshes and swamps are wetlands. wetlands are places where both land-
            <br>dwelling and aquatic animals can coexist. </li></ul></p>
